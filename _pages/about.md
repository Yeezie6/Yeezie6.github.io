I am a third year undergraduate student at Center on Machine Learning Research (CMLR), part of the Department of Computer Science at Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT). My supervisor is Prof. Wangmeng Zuo.

My research interest includes 3d vision. Now, I am exploring the Embodied AI, expecially the Hand-Object Interaction(HOI).
